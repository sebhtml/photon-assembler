De novo assembly of long reads with insertions and deletions

The error rate is 15%.

25.00% -> 1 in 4 bases is wrong
20.00% -> 1 in 5 bases is wrong
16.66% -> 1 in 6 bases is wrong
14.28% -> 1 in 7 bases is wrong
4.76% -> 1 in 21 bases is wrong
3.22% -> 1 in 31 bases is wrong

There are 1024 words of length 5. We can assume that
they will all be occurring in the reads.

Given two reads, that should overlap, then there should be
some common words. For pairs of 2 words, the universe has a size
of 1048576. The problem is that the distance between two common words
will be different because of indel errors.

One possibility is to build a de Bruijn graph with a k-mer length 
of 6. But then, we will simply have a complete graph because of
sequencing errors and because of the small size of the universe.

However, reads can be annotated onto this de Bruijn graph.
The useful thing is the use
